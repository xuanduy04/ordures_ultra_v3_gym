"""Prepare LongCodeBench (LongCodeQA) evaluation data for NeMo Gym.

LongCodeBench is a multi-choice QA benchmark over long code contexts, ported
1-to-1 from the NeMo Skills `longcodebench` dataset. Each row's `question`
field is the long code prompt plus the postfix that instructs the model to
emit `Answer: \\boxed{X}`. The shared `benchmarks/prompts/generic/default.yaml`
template (`user: "{question}"`) wraps it as a single user message, mirroring
Skills' `prompt_format=openai` behaviour.

The resulting Gym JSONL is consumed by the `mcqa` resource server with
`grading_mode=strict_single_letter_boxed`. We provide empty-text option dicts
purely to populate the server's `allowed_letters` set; the option text is not
used for grading because the postfix forces a `\\boxed{X}` answer.

Skills' prepare also stores a `n_tokens_cl100k_base` field counted with
tiktoken. The mcqa verifier never reads it; we omit it on the Gym side to
avoid pulling tiktoken into Gym's main dependency set just for one
benchmark's metadata column.
