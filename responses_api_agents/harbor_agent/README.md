# Harbor Agent for NeMo Gym

This agent integrates [Harbor](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor) into NeMo Gym.
It runs Harbor agents (e.g., `terminus-2`) in Harbor-managed environments and returns NeMo Gym-compatible outputs.

## Overview

### Custom agents

Harbor ships several agents, but for NeMo Gym RL we had to adapt the integration
layer so agent outputs, trajectories, and token metadata are compatible with
NeMo Gym/NeMo RL expectations (especially multi-turn token accounting and rollout
details). In this repo, use the Terminus integration as the reference pattern for
those adaptations.

If you want to plug in a different Harbor agent, follow the Terminus wrapper flow
as an example: keep Harbor's core agent behavior, then add a thin compatibility
layer that normalizes message/output schema and preserves the metadata required by
training.

### Custom environments

The default Harbor environments are not sufficient for HPC training, so this repo 
includes a custom Singularity environment implementation.
It is designed around task-local setup, staged task files, and predictable runtime
paths used by Harbor jobs.
For Singularity installation and image preparation (`docker_image` as `.sif` path vs.
registry reference), see [Quick Start: 2) Set up dependencies and task images](#2-set-up-dependencies-and-task-images).

Any additional task files needed by the environment should be placed under
`environment/files/`. This directory is bind-mounted into the container staging
area and copied into the runtime filesystem during bootstrap, so scripts/assets are
available before agent execution. For a quick refresher on standard Harbor task
structure, see the [Harbor task docs](https://harborframework.com/docs/tasks).

For task setup, this environment supports an optional `environment/files/setup.sh`
script. When present, it is executed during Singularity environment initialization
before agent execution, and is the right place for per-task dependency/setup
steps. In practice, ensure `uvicorn` and `fastapi` are available (for Harbor's
runtime server path in this Singularity flow), either baked into the image or
installed from this setup script.

Common `harbor_environment_kwargs` for this environment:
- `singularity_image_cache_dir`: cache directory for converted `.sif` images.
- `singularity_force_pull`: force re-pull/re-convert the image instead of using cache.
- `singularity_no_mount`: override/suppress selected Singularity default mounts.
- `workdir`: override container working directory.

Singularity does not enforce cgroups-based memory limits on most HPC clusters (no
systemd init). The environment runs a userspace memory watchdog that monitors PSS
and kills the container at 95% of the task's configured `memory_mb`.

## Quick Start

This example uses the [`nvidia/Nemotron-Terminal-Synthetic-Tasks`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Terminal-Synthetic-Tasks) dataset and shows
how to run a small reproducible slice through Harbor Agent + NeMo Gym before scaling
to full training.

### 1) Download the dataset

```bash
hf download \
  nvidia/Nemotron-Terminal-Synthetic-Tasks \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/nemotron_terminal_synthetic_tasks

# From the repo root, unpack only one subset tarball (example: scientific_computing).
tar -xzf responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/nemotron_terminal_synthetic_tasks/skill_based/mixed/scientific_computing.tar.gz -C responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/nemotron_terminal_synthetic_tasks/skill_based/mixed
```

### 2) Set up dependencies and task images

- Install `git` (required because `requirements.txt` installs Harbor from a Git URL)
  and Apptainer/Singularity (required when running Harbor tasks on HPC clusters
  with the Singularity environment).

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git wget
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/download/v1.4.2/apptainer_1.4.2_amd64.deb
apt-get install -y ./apptainer_1.4.2_amd64.deb
apptainer --version
```

- Prepare Apptainer/Singularity images. In each Harbor task's `task.toml`
  (`[environment]` section), set `docker_image` using one of these modes:
  - Pre-built `.sif` mode: `docker_image` points to a local `.sif` file path.
  - Docker reference mode: `docker_image = "repo/image:tag"`, and the
    environment converts that image to `.sif` in the cache directory.
    For examples of downloading and converting to `.sif`, see:
    https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills/blob/main/nemo_skills/dataset/swe-bench/dump_images.py.

For this example workflow, we use the Docker reference mode and build/push
images from task Dockerfiles.

- If you push task images to a private registry, log in first on the Docker
  build machine:

```bash
docker login <registry-host>
```

- If Docker is not available on the Gym machine, use this split workflow:
  1) On a Docker-capable machine, build+push images and write a manifest.
  2) On the Gym machine, rewrite task `docker_image` fields from that manifest.

```bash
# 1) Build machine (Docker available)
python responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/custom_envs/singularity/scripts/build_and_push_images.py \
  --input responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/nemotron_terminal_synthetic_tasks/skill_based/mixed \
  --shared-image-subfolder scientific_computing \
  --registry <registry-host>/<namespace>/<repo> \
  --manifest-out responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/manifests/scientific_computing_manifest.json

# 2) Gym machine (no Docker required)
python responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/custom_envs/singularity/scripts/rewrite_task_tomls.py \
  --manifest-in responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/manifests/scientific_computing_manifest.json
```

- Optional: write minimal task setup.sh files

As noted in [Custom environments](#custom-environments), if tasks need only the
Harbor server dependency bootstrap (`uvicorn` + `fastapi`) and those dependencies
are not already baked into the image, you can
auto-generate `environment/files/setup.sh` with:

```bash
# Write to all discovered tasks (use --force to overwrite existing setup.sh files)
python responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/custom_envs/singularity/scripts/write_min_setup_sh.py \
  --task-root responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/data/nemotron_terminal_synthetic_tasks/skill_based/mixed/scientific_computing
```

### 3) Configure the vLLM model server

Before starting NeMo Gym, launch your vLLM server and update `env.yaml` with the
corresponding `policy_base_url`, `policy_api_key`, and `policy_model_name` values.

If using the harbor agent for RL training, the companion vLLM model server config
must enable token ID information and disable thinking history truncation. Use
`configs/vllm_model_for_training.yaml`.

If you are only collecting rollouts for inspection/debugging (not RL training),
you can use `configs/vllm_model.yaml` instead.

Training config example:

```yaml
policy_model:
  responses_api_models:
    vllm_model:
      entrypoint: app.py
      base_url: ${policy_base_url}
      api_key: ${policy_api_key}
      model: ${policy_model_name}
      chat_template_kwargs:
        enable_thinking: true
        truncate_history_thinking: false
      return_token_id_information: true
      uses_reasoning_parser: true
```

### 4) Configure Harbor agent

The provided config `configs/harbor_agent.yaml` is already set up for this example (custom
`Terminus2NemoGym` + `SingularityEnvironment` with training-oriented kwargs),
but you can modify any fields as needed for your environment.

Dataset selection is alias-based via `harbor_datasets`, and each request must use
`instance_id` in the form `<dataset_alias>::<task_name>`. Example:
`scientific::scientific_computing_task_0001`.
If different datasets require different container working directories, set
`workdir` per alias in `harbor_datasets` (e.g., `/app` vs `/testbed`).
In this integration, alias-level `workdir` is intended for the custom
`SingularityEnvironment`.

### 5) Start NeMo Gym servers

If your task `docker_image` values are private registry references, export
registry credentials before starting the servers:

```bash
export APPTAINER_DOCKER_USERNAME=<registry-username>
export APPTAINER_DOCKER_PASSWORD=<registry-password-or-token>
```

Then start NeMo Gym:

```bash
config_paths="responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/configs/harbor_agent.yaml,\
responses_api_models/vllm_model/configs/vllm_model_for_training.yaml"
ng_run "+config_paths=[${config_paths}]"
```

### 6) Test Harbor agent

```bash
python responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/client.py
```

After a test run, inspect NeMo Gym rollout outputs under `results/`. For Harbor-
specific trial artifacts, use `harbor_jobs_dir` (configured in
`configs/harbor_agent.yaml`, default `jobs/`), where each Harbor run writes a
timestamped job directory containing per-trial outputs and a top-level
`result.json` summary.

### 7) Collect rollouts

```bash
ng_collect_rollouts +agent_name=harbor_agent \
  +input_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/example/example_input.jsonl \
  +output_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/example/example_output.jsonl
```

### 8) View trajectories

```bash
ng_viewer +jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/example/example_output.jsonl
```

## Daytona execution path

Harbor's pinned dependency already includes a Daytona environment. To use it from
NeMo Gym, set `harbor_environment_type: "daytona"` and clear
`harbor_environment_import_path`. The import path takes precedence when it is set,
so changing only `harbor_environment_type` on top of the default Singularity
config is not enough.

Use `configs/harbor_agent_daytona.yaml` as the starting point:

```yaml
harbor_datasets:
  terminal_bench:
    dataset_name: "terminal-bench"
    dataset_version: "2.0"
harbor_environment_type: "daytona"
harbor_environment_import_path: null
harbor_environment_kwargs:
  network_block_all: false
```

The same config keeps the training-oriented `harbor_agent_kwargs` from the
Singularity example:

```yaml
harbor_agent_kwargs:
  max_turns: 20
  interleaved_thinking: true
  enable_summarize: false
  collect_rollout_details: true
  trajectory_config:
    raw_content: true
  model_info:
    max_input_tokens: 49152
    max_output_tokens: 49152
    input_cost_per_token: 0.0
    output_cost_per_token: 0.0
```

Before running, export Daytona credentials:

```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY=<your-daytona-api-key>
```

Then add the policy model server settings to repo-root `env.yaml`, using the
same keys consumed by `responses_api_models/vllm_model/configs/vllm_model.yaml`:

```yaml
policy_base_url: <openai-compatible-base-url>
policy_api_key: <policy-api-key>
policy_model_name: <served-model-name>
```

Then follow the same Harbor-agent workflow with the Daytona config:

```bash
config_paths="responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/configs/harbor_agent_daytona.yaml,\
responses_api_models/vllm_model/configs/vllm_model.yaml"
ng_run "+config_paths=[${config_paths}]"
```

Alternatively, pass those values as CLI overrides:

```bash
ng_run "+config_paths=[${config_paths}]" \
  +policy_base_url=<openai-compatible-base-url> \
  +policy_api_key=<policy-api-key> \
  +policy_model_name=<served-model-name>
```

For five Terminal-Bench rollout inputs, use the checked-in input file:

```bash
ng_collect_rollouts +agent_name=harbor_agent \
  +input_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/example/terminal_bench_daytona_input.jsonl \
  +output_jsonl_fpath=/tmp/harbor_daytona_terminal_bench_output.jsonl
```

Inspect the rollout and Harbor job directory:

```bash
ng_viewer +jsonl_fpath=/tmp/harbor_daytona_terminal_bench_output.jsonl
find responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/jobs -name result.json | tail
```

Daytona uses the Docker image declared by each Harbor task. If a task does not
declare `docker_image`, Harbor builds from that task's `environment/Dockerfile`.

### Terminal-Bench 2.0 example rollouts

The checked-in file
`example/terminal_bench_daytona_output.jsonl` contains five Daytona-backed
Terminal-Bench 2.0 rollout rows from Harbor's Oracle agent. The run completed
with five trials, zero errors, and mean reward `1.000`.

To regenerate the Harbor-side smoke evidence:

```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY=<your-daytona-api-key>

harbor run --dataset terminal-bench@2.0 \
  --n-tasks 5 \
  --agent oracle \
  --env daytona \
  --n-concurrent 1 \
  --jobs-dir responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/jobs/daytona-terminal-bench-examples \
  --job-name oracle-daytona-terminal-bench-5 \
  --quiet
```

### Terminal-Bench 2.0 smoke

For an environment-only smoke that does not require a model provider key, run the
Terminal-Bench 2.0 `fix-git` task through Harbor's Oracle agent on Daytona:

```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY=<your-daytona-api-key>

harbor run --dataset terminal-bench@2.0 \
  --task-name fix-git \
  --agent oracle \
  --env daytona \
  --n-concurrent 1 \
  --jobs-dir responses_api_agents/harbor_agent/jobs/daytona-terminal-bench-smoke \
  --job-name oracle-daytona-fix-git \
  --quiet
```

Expected result: one trial, zero errors, and `Mean: 1.000`. This validates the
Harbor registry path, Daytona sandbox creation, agent execution, and verifier
without involving NeMo Gym's model-server routing.

## NeMo RL Training

### Required patches to Gym

Pass `chat_template_kwargs` to the tokenize endpoint.

**`Gym/responses_api_models/vllm_model/app.py`** — the `/tokenize` endpoint must
receive `chat_template_kwargs` (e.g., `truncate_history_thinking: false`) to match
the tokenization used during chat completion. Without this, the tokenize call uses
the template's default `truncate_history_thinking=True`, which strips reasoning from
historical messages and breaks token contiguity in multi-turn training.

Change the tokenize body construction from:

```python
for key in ("model", "messages", "tools"):
    if key in body_dict:
        tokenize_body_dict[key] = body_dict[key]
```

To:

```python
for key in ("model", "messages", "tools", "chat_template_kwargs"):
    if key in body_dict:
        tokenize_body_dict[key] = body_dict[key]
```

### Recommended settings

These are the recommended settings for the NeMo RL training config:

```yaml
env:
  nemo_gym:
    use_absolute_ip: true               # Required for multi-node Ray clusters
    harbor_agent:
      responses_api_agents:
        harbor_agent:
          # Match concurrency to total rollouts per step for maximum throughput.
          concurrency: ${mul:${grpo.num_prompts_per_step}, ${grpo.num_generations_per_prompt}}

          # Limit on how long a single rollout can run (including all turns).
          # You can also set a per-task timeout in task.toml via [agent].timeout_sec.
          # If harbor_agent_max_timeout is set here, Harbor keeps per-task timeouts
          # but clamps longer ones to this maximum.
          harbor_agent_max_timeout: 900

          harbor_agent_kwargs:
            max_turns: 20                # Max turns per rollout. Configure this for your dataset.
            interleaved_thinking: true
            enable_summarize: false
            collect_rollout_details: true
            trajectory_config:
              raw_content: true
            model_info:
              max_input_tokens: ${policy.max_total_sequence_length}
              max_output_tokens: ${policy.max_total_sequence_length}
```

Additional policy settings required for multi-node training:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    vllm_kwargs:
      enable_chunked_prefill: false     # Disable chunked prefill for stability
```

### Finding failed rollouts

Harbor writes each rollout to a subdirectory under `harbor_jobs_dir`. A practical
way to debug is to inspect trajectories by run timestamp: start from the relevant
timestamped job directory, then drill into per-rollout subdirectories and compare
`trajectory.json`, verifier outputs, and exception files across nearby runs.
Because each rollout can produce several artifacts, file counts can grow quickly
on long-running cluster jobs. Job outputs are grouped by day in `harbor_jobs_dir`
(for example `jobs/YYYYMMDD/...`), so cleanup is simple.

### Known failure cases during RL training

When the Harbor agent fails during rollout collection, the sample returns `reward=0.0`
and an empty `output` list (no output items with `generation_token_ids`). 

Common symptom: `IndexError: list index out of range` at `rollouts.py:1185`. This
usually means at least one rollout returned an empty `input_message_log`, and a
single failed rollout then crashes the entire training step. To identify which
rollout failed, scan the harbor job directories.

A recommended mitigation is to tolerate empty/failed rollouts by marking them as
degenerate, keeping training alive, and excluding those samples from gradient
contribution while tracking their rate in metrics.

**Failure scenarios that produce empty output:**

- **Context length exceeded on the first turn**: the model cannot generate any tokens,
  so there are no `generation_token_ids` to collect. `Terminus2NemoGym.run()` catches
  `ContextLengthExceededError` and returns gracefully, but if no turns completed, the
  output is empty.
- **Singularity environment setup failure**: `upload_file` or `upload_dir` fails during
  container initialization (e.g., tmux_session uploads `get-asciinema-timestamp.sh` to
  `/tmp`). The trial raises `RuntimeError` before the agent runs any turns.
- **Unhandled exception in `run_harbor_job`**: `app.py` catches all exceptions, sets
  `output_items=[]` and `reward=0.0`.

**Scenarios that preserve partial trajectories (do NOT produce empty output):**

- **Agent timeout**: Harbor handles `AgentTimeoutError` internally in `trial.py`.
  Terminus-2's `finally` block writes `trajectory.json` with all completed steps before
  the coroutine is cancelled, and the trial proceeds to verification. The partial
  trajectory flows through `app.py` normally — completed turns have `generation_token_ids`
  and are usable for training.
- **Context length exceeded on a later turn** (listed above): same behavior — completed
  turns are preserved.

### On-policy corrections for multi-turn training

In multi-turn RL training, turn `N+1` is built from the full conversation history
up to turn `N`. If that history is reconstructed from text, token alignment can
silently drift and break on-policy training assumptions.

Nemo-RL applies on-policy token corrections to preserve prompt/continuation
contiguity across turns. Details:
https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/gym/latest/contribute/rl-framework-integration/openai-compatible-http-server-on-policy-correction.html
