# Description

This is a resources server for verifying terminal-based agent actions. It evaluates agent responses that represent terminal command sequences against expected answers. The server supports two different schema formats (`terminus_1` and `terminus_2`) for terminal interaction tasks.

For each verification request, the agent's JSON output is validated through multiple checks:
1. **JSON Parsing**: The model output must be valid JSON
2. **Schema Validation**: The response must conform to the specified harness schema (`terminus_1` or `terminus_2`)
3. **Task Completion**: If the expected answer requires task completion, the agent must also indicate completion
4. **Command Correctness**: The predicted keystrokes must exactly match the expected keystrokes in order
  - This is evaluated via string similarity and equivalency llm-as-judge


## Supported Schemas

### terminus_1
- `state_analysis`: Description of the current terminal state
- `explanation`: Brief explanation of what the commands will do
- `commands`: List of command objects with `keystrokes`, `is_blocking`, and `timeout_sec`
- `is_task_complete`: Boolean indicating if the task is complete

### terminus_2
- `analysis`: Analysis of the current state based on terminal output
- `plan`: Description of the plan for next steps
- `commands`: List of command objects with `keystrokes` and optional `duration`
- `task_complete`: Boolean indicating if the task is complete (optional)


# Example usage

## Running servers

The following command can be used to run this resources server, along with the simple agent and a policy model:

```bash
config_paths="resources_servers/terminus_judge/configs/terminus_judge.yaml,\
responses_api_models/openai_model/configs/openai_model.yaml"

ng_run "+config_paths=[$config_paths]" \
  +terminus_judge_resources_server.resources_servers.terminus_judge.judge_responses_create_params.max_output_tokens=512
```

Then, rollouts can be collected using a command such as the following:

```bash
ng_collect_rollouts +agent_name=terminus_judge_simple_agent \
    +input_jsonl_fpath=resources_servers/terminus_judge/data/example.jsonl \
    +output_jsonl_fpath=resources_servers/terminus_judge/example_rollouts.jsonl
```

## Expected Data Format

Each data sample should include:
- `expected_answer`: A JSON string containing the expected terminal commands
- `metadata.harness`: Either `"terminus_1"` or `"terminus_2"` to specify the schema format
- `threshold`: threshold for string similarity to calculate the reward

## Dataset Availability

The train and validation datasets for this environment are not yet publicly released.

**What is available:**
- 5 example tasks committed to this repository at `data/example.jsonl`. These cover both `terminus_1` and `terminus_2` schema variants and work with the setup instructions above.

The examples in `data/example.jsonl`, the descriptions here, and the environment implementation are the best starting point for understanding the format and creating new tasks.
