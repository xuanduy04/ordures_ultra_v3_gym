# Equivalence LLM-as-judge Resources Server

### Overview
Uses an LLM as a judge to compare a model’s generated answer against the expected answer.

Prompt and labels are configurable via config.

An example dataset for this resources server can be found at:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-RL-knowledge-openqa 

### Key config fields
- `judge_system_message`: optional system message. If omitted, no system message is added.
- `judge_prompt_template` (required): user prompt template. Placeholders: `{question}`, `{expected_answer}`, `{generated_answer}`.
- `judge_equal_label` / `judge_not_equal_label`: labels the judge must output. Defaults to `[[A=B]]` and `[[A!=B]]`.
- `check_twice_swap` (bool, default false): if true, after an initial equal verdict, performs a second judge call swapping expected and generated answers to reduce bias.
- `reward_if_swap_fails` (float, default 0.0): reward to assign if the second (swap) pass disagrees (i.e., fails). You may set this to -1.0 or other value to catch it on the training side..
- `use_per_record_regex` (bool, default true): if true, use per-record regex from `template_metadata.output_regex` to extract answers. Enables mixed datasets with different answer formats. Safe to enable - falls back to global regex when no per-record regex present.
- `check_full_generation_on_fail` (bool, default true): if true, when regex extraction fails, retry with full generation (no regex) for partial credit. Only activates when per-record regex exists.
- `reward_if_full_generation_succeeds` (float, default 0.5): reward when full generation check succeeds after extraction failure. Set to 1.0 for full credit.
- `extraction_length_threshold` (int, default 120): skip regex extraction when expected answer exceeds this length. Use full generation instead. Only applies when per-record regex is present. Set to null to disable.

### Input schema
Accepts the same outer request structure as other resources servers:
- `responses_create_params`: the original model query (used here to extract a question/context string from user messages for the judge prompt).
- `response`: the model output in OpenAI Responses schema. The last assistant message text is used as the generated answer.
- `expected_answer`: gold answer to compare against.

### Example config
```yaml
equivalence_llm_judge:
  resources_servers:
    equivalence_llm_judge:
      entrypoint: app.py

equivalence_llm_judge_simple_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    simple_agent:
      entrypoint: app.py
      resources_server:
        type: resources_servers
        name: equivalence_llm_judge
      model_server:
        type: responses_api_models
        name: openai_model
      datasets:
      - name: sciq_validation
        type: example
        jsonl_fpath: resources_servers/equivalence_llm_judge/data/sciq_validation.jsonl
```

### Usage
Spin up with a judge model and prompt:
```bash
config_paths="resources_servers/equivalence_llm_judge/configs/equivalence_llm_judge.yaml,\
responses_api_models/openai_model/configs/openai_model.yaml"

ng_run "+config_paths=[$config_paths]" \
  +equivalence_llm_judge.resources_servers.equivalence_llm_judge.judge_responses_create_params.max_output_tokens=256 \
  +equivalence_llm_judge.resources_servers.equivalence_llm_judge.judge_system_message="You are a careful arbiter." \
  "+equivalence_llm_judge.resources_servers.equivalence_llm_judge.judge_prompt_template='<|Problem|>\n{question}\n\n<|Gold|>\n{expected_answer}\n\n<|Prediction|>\n{generated_answer}\n'"
```

Then query via any agent; verification happens with `/verify` on this server when evaluating rollouts.

For our tests we used Gemma3-27B-it.  
You should always check the license of your chosen judge model to make sure your use case comply with it.

### Notes
- By default (`check_twice_swap=false`), the server performs a single judge pass. If the verdict is equal, reward is 1 and one evaluation is returned; if not equal, reward is 0 and one evaluation is returned.
- If `check_twice_swap=true` and the first pass is equal, a second pass is performed with expected and generated answers swapped. Reward is 1 only if the second pass is also equal; otherwise `reward_if_swap_fails` is used (default 0.0). In the double-check case, two evaluations are returned.
- If the judge output doesn't include either label, it defaults to not-equal.
- **OpenQA support (enabled by default)**: The server now enables per-record regex extraction (`use_per_record_regex=true`), full generation rescue (`check_full_generation_on_fail=true`), and length-based thresholds (`extraction_length_threshold=120`) by default. These features only activate when `template_metadata.output_regex` is present, making them safe for all datasets. They reduce false negatives from regex extraction failures while maintaining backward compatibility.
